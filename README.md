Creating a deep learning model which can explain the contents of an image in the form of speech through caption generation with an attention mechanism on Flickr8K dataset. 

This project is an application of both deep learning and natural language processing. The features of an image will be extracted by a CNN-based encoder and this will be decoded by an RNN model.
